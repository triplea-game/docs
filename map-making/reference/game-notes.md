## Game Notes

- Game notes are stored in a file alongside game XML files.
- Notes are written in HTML

### File Naming

Game notes files should have the same name as a game XML file but with a
`.notes.html` suffix. For example:

```
world_at_war.xml -> world_at_war.notes.html
my_game_file.xml -> my_game_file.notes.html
```

### Contents

Game notes content should be straight HTML without 'body', 'head' or 'html' tags.
