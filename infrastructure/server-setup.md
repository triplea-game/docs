# Add a linode server

Login to linode and create a server.

# Adding DNS Entries

Create a DNS entries on [namecheap.com > account > dashboard > "manage" button > "advanced DNS"
](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/triplea-game.org/advancedns)

All servers will have both an 'A' (IPv4 address) and 'AAAA' (IPv6 address) record.
You can get both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from the linode dashboard.

## Update inventory file

- Add the server to [inventory configuration](/infrastructure/ansible/inventory)
- Commit the changes and submit for a PR. After the PR is merged, travis will run a deployment
  automatically deploying all needed configurations to the server.

## Run Github Action "Provision"

In github actions, find the "deploy server provisioning" action and run it. This is
a one-time step.
