## About TripleA

TripleA is a fan created (2002), open source strategy and board game engine where you can play Axis and
Allies style rules on community created maps. TripleA has a well-developed AI and an active lobby for live
multiplayer games. Over 100 user-created maps are available via in-game download.

In TripleA you can recreate World War 2 with the Axis pushing through to Moscow and the Allies desperately
fighting back. Or recreate Napoleon's march across Europe, or Rome defeating the Carthaginian Empire,
or Sauron conquering Middle Earth! If you have ever played a game where you push little plastic
pieces around, roll dice and conquer the lands of your enemy, you will be able to jump right into TripleA!
